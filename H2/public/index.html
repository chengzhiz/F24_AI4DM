  <body>
    1. **Personal or Contextual Information:** LLMs don’t know personal details about you or your life, so they can’t
    give advice based on your specific situation.<br>

    2. **Personal Opinions:** LLMs don’t have personal feelings or opinions, so they can’t answer questions about what
    someone might like or prefer.<br>

    3. **Predicting the Future:** LLMs can’t predict the future. They only know things that have already happened, so
    they can’t tell you what will happen later.<br>

    4. **Deep Personal Issues:** LLMs aren’t able to help with very personal problems. These kinds of questions need a
    deep understanding of emotions, which LLMs don’t have.<br>

    5. **Medical or Legal Advice:** LLMs shouldn’t be used for advice on health or legal issues. You should talk to a
    doctor or lawyer for these kinds of questions.<br>

    6. **Questions Using Senses:** LLMs can only understand text, not things you can see, hear, or feel. They can’t
    answer questions that need sensory information like sounds or images.<br>

    7. **Emotions or Relationships:** LLMs don’t understand human emotions or relationships well. They can’t help with
    questions about feelings or personal connections.<br>

    8. **Art or Literature Interpretation:** LLMs don’t have personal insight, so they can’t really interpret art or
    literature in a deep, emotional way like people can.<br>

    9. **Speculative or Theoretical Questions:** LLMs can’t answer questions about things that haven’t been proven yet
    or are just theories. They stick to facts that are known.<br>

    10. **General Knowledge and Fact-Checking:** LLMs are really good at answering general knowledge questions and
    checking facts, as long as the information is something they have learned before. They’re great for questions about
    history, science, and technical details.</body>
